### Collection View and Auto Layout

This project gave me an opportunity to dive deep into UICollectionView and Auto Layout. I learned how to layer views to create
a custom UI based on a collection view. I also learned more about how to customize various UI elements, both programmatically and in the 
storyboard. This included the UINavigation, UISearchBar, and custom font. Working with git was also a challenge, but I ended the 
project with a greater understanding of the git workflow.
