### Project planning and Git methodology

I realized how much more time is needed for pre-modeling before actually coding any project.  It was tough developing a project with new code or ideas while maintaining a standard code structure to avoid merge conflicts. I've probably learned bad Git habit while manually downloading new files, but have a  much better understanding as to how useful Git can be when developing projects with others.

### Collection View and Auto Layout

This project gave me an opportunity to dive deep into UICollectionView and Auto Layout. I learned how to layer views to create
a custom UI based on a collection view. I also learned more about how to customize various UI elements, both programmatically and in the storyboard. This included the UINavigation, UISearchBar, and custom font. Working with git was also a challenge, but I ended the project with a greater understanding of the git workflow.
